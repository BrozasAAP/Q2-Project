            <p>The Philippines and picture-perfect beaches go together like a bucket and spade. The country is made up of more than 7000 islands, and almost all of them boast at least one stretch of pristine golden sand with iconic bangka boats bobbing in shallow teal waters offshore.  With its extensive coastline, the country offers the best of island beaches, white sand blue water teeming with marine life, corals and lush foliage. The Philippines is blessed with a moderate climate making it an ideal sun holiday destination.

                    <p class="b-text">Bohol is a province of the Philippines, in the countryâ€™s Central Visayas region. It comprises Bohol Island and numerous smaller surrounding islands. Bohol is known for coral reefs and unusual geological formations, notably the Chocolate Hills. On the main island, near the town of Carmen, these 1,200 or so symmetrical mounds turn cocoa-brown in the dry season, contrasting with the surrounding jungle's greenery.</p>
